      "Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I have recently graduated from University College, and I am currently looking for a position in the Huntington area. I am interested in an entry-level role with Company’s Accounting department, hoping to leverage my knowledge of corporate accounting and best practices to contribute to your operations. I have heard that is a wonderful company to work for, and I hope that I can be considered for the team. If you have questions regarding my credentials and qualifications, please feel free to call or email me at. Again, thank you for reviewing my resume. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. For the past ten years, I have followed your career through news events, interviews, and web research. Your dedication to the media and your understanding of the important role journalists play in today's fast-paced information highway, coupled with your belief in the power of the press, is exemplary. I have had the privilege of honing my journalistic abilities on three widely different publications. When I left college, I immediately went to work for the typical small town newspaper and learned all aspects of getting the paper to the people in a timely manner. I then moved to become Regional Manager for a media corporation composed of small- to mid-sized newspapers in the Midwest. In my current position, I am Chief Correspondent for one of the largest newspapers in the Southwest. I would like an opportunity to visit with you to get your insight and suggestions on where my skills and abilities would be of the greatest value to the Company, and to inquire about possible job openings with the company. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your consideration. I want to apologize for mixing up the files for Company and Company. My careless mistake hurt our sales pitches, and almost lost us two key clients. When we work together on a sales pitch, I realize it is important that we can confidently rely on each other to complete our assignments. When I made a mistake, I let you down. I am currently developing strategies to ensure that I never make that kind of sloppy error again. I have developed an even clearer organization for my online client files that will make it impossible for me to confuse one file for another. I have also spoken with our supervisor and explained that the error was completely my fault, not yours. I understand that I have damaged our working relationship. However, I greatly value you as a colleague, and I believe that we have worked well together as a sales team in the past. I hope that you will be willing to work together in the future. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make this possible. I am very sorry for my behavior in the staff meeting this morning. I cut you off in the middle of your presentation and criticized your performance in front of the staff. This was not only unprofessional but also simply disrespectful. I let my stress about a personal matter impact my management of the office. I have always said to you, and to all my employees, that I want this office to be a place where you all feel comfortable sharing ideas with one another. When I yelled at you publicly for a small error in your presentation, I damaged that collaborative environment. I am taking steps to make sure I do not lose my temper in that way again. I am working to manage my stress so that I do not let it impact the way I interact with my employees. I also know how capable you are of conducting a terrific staff meeting. I would, therefore, love for you to lead the staff meeting next week. I am very sorry again. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter further. Thank you again for meeting with me today. I truly enjoyed our conversation and gained valuable insights into content strategy and building a career in media. I’ve already investigated the classes you suggested, as well as the writer’s union, and will continue working on building my own personal brand using your (extremely helpful!) advice. As you said during our chat, you really can’t learn everything you need to know about this industry in school. I’m extremely grateful that you took the time to steer me in the right direction. Thanks again, and best regards.Thank you very much for introducing me to Theodore Mannix of Cryptic Industries. He has been very helpful to me during my job search and has even offered to put me in touch with some of his colleagues. I am hopeful that through these new contacts, I will find a new position soon. Your help and support during this search are greatly appreciated. Having someone with your knowledge and experience to confer with has made me feel much more confident during this difficult process. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. I am grateful for the time you spent reviewing my career objectives and recommending strategies for achieving them. I especially appreciate your offer to connect me to others in your network. I plan on following up with the contacts you emailed me right away. I will also use the online networking resources you recommended to further my job search. Any additional suggestions you may have would be welcome. I'll update you as my search progresses. Again, thank you so much for your help. I greatly appreciate the assistance you have provided me. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for your referral to Frontier Media. After reaching out to your contact about an informational interview, I was later asked to return for a formal interview. I am thrilled to tell you that I was offered a job. I have accepted a full-time Account Manager position, and I am very much looking forward to working with Frontier. I can’t thank you enough for connecting me with your contacts there. I deeply appreciate you sharing your networking resources with me, and I’m honored that you thought of me as a good fit for such an outstanding company. Your belief in me to succeed is an inspiration, and I will do my absolute best to live up to your confidence. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if, at some point, you think of any way I can return the favor. I am happy to introduce you to any of my past or present colleagues. Of course, if you find yourself in need of a reference letter or recommendation at any point, I am more than happy to contribute in that way, too. Thanks again, and let’s stay in touch. I will be sure to update you about my experience at Frontier, and I look forward to hearing about your own progress, as well.

I will be sure to update you about my experience at Frontier, and I look forward to hearing about your own progress, as well. First, I would like to thank you very much for your referral to Five Star Production. I am sincerely grateful that you thought of me as a strong candidate for the Sales and Ticketing Coordinator role. Additionally, I appreciate you taking the time to alert me to the opening of this position and to recommend me as a good fit for the job. However, I am disappointed to let you know that I was not hired for the job. Though your contact in Human Resources, Mr. Jameson, expressed his admiration for my enthusiasm and willingness to work hard in this role. Unfortunately, Five Star is looking for someone with specific experience in large-scale event production. As you know, my background is in television production, though I am still actively looking to transition fields. Thank you again for the job lead. If you happen to hear of any other positions that would be a good match or can share any other resources that you think might benefit the development of my career, I would love for you to me let me know. I very much look up to you as a Production Supervisor and would be thrilled to learn as much as I can from a respected peer. Meanwhile, if there is any way you think I might be able to return the favor, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I am always here to help in any way I can. I was very pleased to hear that you have been offered a position at the Garnet Company after graduation. You have my heartfelt congratulations both on graduating and on earning your new position. I know that Garnet Company was one of the “Top 3” employers you’d hoped that you could work for, so you must be beyond thrilled to be onboarding with them! These are exciting changes, and I'm sure you will meet the challenges they bring with your usual optimism, creativity, and capability. I wish you all the best as you move forward in your new career. How wonderful to learn that all of your hard work at XYZ University has paid off in your new job offer. It has been a pleasure to work with you over the course of the past two years – your dedication to your studies and your willingness to help your peers has truly contributed to the productivity and morale of our department. I know that Majors Brothers Firm will be gaining a talented and congenial junior associate in you. Best wishes for much joy and success in your professional endeavors. Congratulations on your new position with the Sunshine Agency. I'm sure you will be an asset to their staff, with your years of experience and organizational skills, not to mention your easygoing personality. You will be greatly missed here, but I speak for the whole team in wishing you all the best in your new endeavor! I don’t know whether it was with more joy or sadness that I learned the news that you’ll be moving on to Jones, Able, and Jellico. I’m really proud of you for getting hired for your “dream job,” but boy, will we miss you around here! My congratulations are heartfelt – please keep in touch and let us know how you’re enjoying the challenges of your new position.Yours truly. I heard you got the job you've always wanted. Cheers to your continued success! This position was truly made for you. Congratulations on finding such a perfect opportunity. I'm so thrilled to hear you got your dream job. Would love to celebrate the occasion with you! Your new company made the right choice in hiring someone like you. You deserve all the rewards to come. Congratulations on your new endeavor! I'm so thrilled that you'll be working on something you're passionate about. Your talent will truly be appreciated in this new role. They're lucky to have you! It was a pleasure and an honor working with you. Your new role is well deserved, and I wish you success in your new job. I know you've waited a long time to find this job, and it's inspiring to see you fulfill your dream. You are a force to be reckoned with in this field, and I'm so proud to know you and to have worked with you. Our loss is ABC Company’s gain. We will miss you enormously around here, but it will be exciting to hear about your new adventures. You are indeed the best person for your new job. Kudos to you for reaching this wonderful milestone. You are proof that dedication and determination go a long way. You inspire me! While we'll miss your valuable contributions and dedication, I am so glad you got a new job that excites you. Your new job is a perfect match for you. I wish you continued success. Good morning. There are some exciting changes coming to our department that I wish to alert you to. Due to ABC Inc.’s recent acquisition of XYZ Company, our executive management has decided that some restructuring of our department is in order so that our transition through this merger can be as seamless as possible. This is, in general, very good news for all of us, for we will be onboarding ten new sales representatives – which will both relieve our current understaffing situation and prepare us for the heightened sales operations this merger is anticipated to trigger. I am scheduling a staff meeting for tomorrow from 12 pm to 1 pm where I will outline the steps of this important transition; lunch will be provided. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time during the next few weeks with any questions or concerns. Best regards. As you are aware, the recent economic downturn has adversely affected Broadway Inc. To increase cash flow and limit layoffs, the company has decided that salary reductions are necessary at this time. We are asking all employees to accept an 8% pay cut. The executive staff has already taken the same pay cut. We are asking to reduce your monthly salary from $4,000 to $3,680 beginning one month from now. Your current position and duties will remain the same. During this period, we will continue to monitor the company's financial situation. If the economic situation and the company's performance improves in the next two quarters of the year, your former salary may be restored. If you decide to decline this reduction in pay, you will be removed from your position effective one month from today, with severance pay. We appreciate all the hard work you have put into your position at this company, and we do not want to lose you as an invaluable employee. Your understanding, support, and co-operation to help Broadway Inc. endure the current economic situation is greatly appreciated. This letter confirms our discussion today that your employment with Willis Corporation is terminated effective immediately. You will receive two weeks severance pay since your employment with Willis Corporation has been less than one year. You will receive the severance payment once you have signed and returned the enclosed release of claims document. Additionally, payment for your accrued PTO will be included in your final paycheck* which you will receive on our regular payday, Friday. You may pick up this check from the reception desk or we can mail it to your home. Let us know about your choice. You can expect a separate benefits status letter that will outline the status of your benefits upon termination. The letter will include information about your eligibility for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation of group health coverage. We have received from you already your security swipe card, your office key, and the company-owned laptop and cell phone at the termination meeting. You will need to keep the company informed of your contact information so that we are able to provide the information you may need in the future such as your W-2 form and followup COBRA information.Please let us know if we can assist you during your transition. The purpose of this letter is to follow up with you after your termination meeting this morning. It contains information you will need as you seek new employment opportunities. First, due to the termination of your employment, if you return to the workplace, your presence will be considered trespassing. You cleared out your cubicle and took all of your personal belongings with you and you turned in your company laptop and employee badge so you should have no reason to return. We are not offering you any severance pay because your employment was terminated for a cause which we covered with you at the termination meeting. Your accrued PTO will be included in your final paycheck* which you will receive on our regular payday, one week from this Friday. We will mail your final paycheck to the address we have on record which is where we are sending this termination letter. If this is not the proper address for the paycheck, please send an email to the HR manager, Ellen Parling, with the preferred address. We will send a separate benefits status letter that will outline the benefits you will receive following the termination of your employment. The letter will include information about your eligibility for COBRA, a continuation of group health coverage. Please keep the HR office up-to-date on your contact information so that we are able to provide the information you may need in the future such as your W-2 form and the follow-up COBRA information. Thank you for your offer of the position of Regional Manager of Product Development for the Witten Company. I am impressed with the depth of knowledge of your development team and believe that my experience will help to maximize the profitability of the department. I would like to meet with you regarding the salary and benefits you have offered before I make a final decision. I feel that with the skills, experience, and contacts in the industry that I would bring to Witten, further discussion of my compensation would be appropriate. Thank you very much for your consideration.\n",

       "\"Thank you for taking the time to review my resume  I have recently graduated from University College, and I am currently looking for a position in the Huntington area  I am interested in an entry-level role with Company’s Accounting department, hoping to leverage my knowledge of corporate accounting and best practices to contribute to your operations  I have heard that is a wonderful company to work for, and I hope that I can be considered for the team  If you have questions regarding my credentials and qualifications, please feel free to call or email me at  Again, thank you for reviewing my resume  I look forward to hearing from you in the near future  For the past ten years, I have followed your career through news events, interviews, and web research  Your dedication to the media and your understanding of the important role journalists play in today's fast-paced information highway, coupled with your belief in the power of the press, is exemplary  I have had the privilege of honing my journalistic abilities on three widely different publications  When I left college, I immediately went to work for the typical small town newspaper and learned all aspects of getting the paper to the people in a timely manner  I then moved to become Regional Manager for a media corporation composed of small- to mid-sized newspapers in the Midwest  In my current position, I am Chief Correspondent for one of the largest newspapers in the Southwest  I would like an opportunity to visit with you to get your insight and suggestions on where my skills and abilities would be of the greatest value to the Company, and to inquire about possible job openings with the company  I look forward to hearing from you  Thank you for your consideration  I want to apologize for mixing up the files for Company and Company  My careless mistake hurt our sales pitches, and almost lost us two key clients  When we work together on a sales pitch, I realize it is important that we can confidently rely on each other to complete our assignments  When I made a mistake, I let you down  I am currently developing strategies to ensure that I never make that kind of sloppy error again  I have developed an even clearer organization for my online client files that will make it impossible for me to confuse one file for another  I have also spoken with our supervisor and explained that the error was completely my fault, not yours  I understand that I have damaged our working relationship  However, I greatly value you as a colleague, and I believe that we have worked well together as a sales team in the past  I hope that you will be willing to work together in the future  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make this possible  I am very sorry for my behavior in the staff meeting this morning  I cut you off in the middle of your presentation and criticized your performance in front of the staff  This was not only unprofessional but also simply disrespectful  I let my stress about a personal matter impact my management of the office  I have always said to you, and to all my employees, that I want this office to be a place where you all feel comfortable sharing ideas with one another  When I yelled at you publicly for a small error in your presentation, I damaged that collaborative environment  I am taking steps to make sure I do not lose my temper in that way again  I am working to manage my stress so that I do not let it impact the way I interact with my employees  I also know how capable you are of conducting a terrific staff meeting  I would, therefore, love for you to lead the staff meeting next week  I am very sorry again  Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this matter further  Thank you again for meeting with me today  I truly enjoyed our conversation and gained valuable insights into content strategy and building a career in media  I’ve already investigated the classes you suggested, as well as the writer’s union, and will continue working on building my own personal brand using your (extremely helpful!) advice  As you said during our chat, you really can’t learn everything you need to know about this industry in school  I’m extremely grateful that you took the time to steer me in the right direction  Thanks again, and best regards Thank you very much for introducing me to Theodore Mannix of Cryptic Industries  He has been very helpful to me during my job search and has even offered to put me in touch with some of his colleagues  I am hopeful that through these new contacts, I will find a new position soon  Your help and support during this search are greatly appreciated  Having someone with your knowledge and experience to confer with has made me feel much more confident during this difficult process  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today  I am grateful for the time you spent reviewing my career objectives and recommending strategies for achieving them  I especially appreciate your offer to connect me to others in your network  I plan on following up with the contacts you emailed me right away  I will also use the online networking resources you recommended to further my job search  Any additional suggestions you may have would be welcome  I'll update you as my search progresses  Again, thank you so much for your help  I greatly appreciate the assistance you have provided me  I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for your referral to Frontier Media  After reaching out to your contact about an informational interview, I was later asked to return for a formal interview  I am thrilled to tell you that I was offered a job  I have accepted a full-time Account Manager position, and I am very much looking forward to working with Frontier  I can’t thank you enough for connecting me with your contacts there  I deeply appreciate you sharing your networking resources with me, and I’m honored that you thought of me as a good fit for such an outstanding company  Your belief in me to succeed is an inspiration, and I will do my absolute best to live up to your confidence  Please don’t hesitate to reach out if, at some point, you think of any way I can return the favor  I am happy to introduce you to any of my past or present colleagues  Of course, if you find yourself in need of a reference letter or recommendation at any point, I am more than happy to contribute in that way, too  Thanks again, and let’s stay in touch  I will be sure to update you about my experience at Frontier, and I look forward to hearing about your own progress, as well  I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for your referral to Frontier Media  After reaching out to your contact about an

Frontier, and I look forward to hearing about your own progress, as well  First, I would like to thank you very much for your referral to Five Star Production  I am sincerely grateful that you thought of me as a strong candidate for the Sales and Ticketing Coordinator role  Additionally, I appreciate you taking the time to alert me to the opening of this position and to recommend me as a good fit for the job  However, I am disappointed to let you know that I was not hired for the job  Though your contact in Human Resources, Mr  Jameson, expressed his admiration for my enthusiasm and willingness to work hard in this role  Unfortunately, Five Star is looking for someone with specific experience in large-scale event production  As you know, my background is in television production, though I am still actively looking to transition fields  Thank you again for the job lead  If you happen to hear of any other positions that would be a good match or can share any other resources that you think might benefit the development of my career, I would love for you to me let me know  I very much look up to you as a Production Supervisor and would be thrilled to learn as much as I can from a respected peer  Meanwhile, if there is any way you think I might be able to return the favor, please don’t hesitate to reach out  I am always here to help in any way I can  I was very pleased to hear that you have been offered a position at the Garnet Company after graduation  You have my heartfelt congratulations both on graduating and on earning your new position  I know that Garnet Company was one of the “Top 3” employers you’d hoped that you could work for, so you must be beyond thrilled to be onboarding with them! These are exciting changes, and I'm sure you will meet the challenges they bring with your usual optimism, creativity, and capability  I wish you all the best as you move forward in your new career  How wonderful to learn that all of your hard work at XYZ University has paid off in your new job offer  It has been a pleasure to work with you over the course of the past two years – your dedication to your studies and your willingness to help your peers has truly contributed to the productivity and morale of our department  I know that Majors Brothers Firm will be gaining a talented and congenial junior associate in you  Best wishes for much joy and success in your professional endeavors  Congratulations on your new position with the Sunshine Agency  I'm sure you will be an asset to their staff, with your years of experience and organizational skills, not to mention your easygoing personality  You will be greatly missed here, but I speak for the whole team in wishing you all the best in your new endeavor! I don’t know whether it was with more joy or sadness that I learned the news that you’ll be moving on to Jones, Able, and Jellico  I’m really proud of you for getting hired for your “dream job,” but boy, will we miss you around here! My congratulations are heartfelt – please keep in touch and let us know how you’re enjoying the challenges of your new position Yours truly  I heard you got the job you've always wanted  Cheers to your continued success! This position was truly made for you  Congratulations on finding such a perfect opportunity  I'm so thrilled to hear you got your dream job  Would love to celebrate the occasion with you! Your new company made the right choice in hiring someone like you  You deserve all the rewards to come  Congratulations on your new endeavor! I'm so thrilled that you'll be working on something you're passionate about  Your talent will truly be appreciated in this new role  They're lucky to have you! It was a pleasure and an honor working with you  Your new role is well deserved, and I wish you success in your new job  I know you've waited a long time to find this job, and it's inspiring to see you fulfill your dream  You are a force to be reckoned with in this field, and I'm so proud to know you and to have worked with you  Our loss is ABC Company’s gain  We will miss you enormously around here, but it will be exciting to hear about your new adventures  You are indeed the best person for your new job  Kudos to you for reaching this wonderful milestone  You are proof that dedication and determination go a long way  You inspire me! While we'll miss your valuable contributions and dedication, I am so glad you got a new job that excites you  Your new job is a perfect match for you  I wish you continued success  Good morning  There are some exciting changes coming to our department that I wish to alert you to  Due to ABC Inc ’s recent acquisition of XYZ Company, our executive management has decided that some restructuring of our department is in order so that our transition through this merger can be as seamless as possible  This is, in general, very good news for all of us, for we will be onboarding ten new sales representatives – which will both relieve our current understaffing situation and prepare us for the heightened sales operations this merger is anticipated to trigger  I am scheduling a staff meeting for tomorrow from 12 pm to 1 pm where I will outline the steps of this important transition; lunch will be provided  Please feel free to reach out to me at any time during the next few weeks with any questions or concerns  Best regards  As you are aware, the recent economic downturn has adversely affected Broadway Inc  To increase cash flow and limit layoffs, the company has decided that salary reductions are necessary at this time  We are asking all employees to accept an 8% pay cut  The executive staff has already taken the same pay cut  We are asking to reduce your monthly salary from $4,000 to $3,680 beginning one month from now  Your current position and duties will remain the same  During this period, we will continue to monitor the company's financial situation  If the economic situation and the company's performance improves in the next two quarters of the year, your former salary may be restored  If you decide to decline this reduction in pay, you will be removed from your position effective one month from today, with severance pay  We appreciate all the hard work you have put into your position at this company, and we do not want to lose you as an invaluable employee  Your understanding, support, and co-operation to help Broadway Inc  endure the current economic situation is greatly appreciated  This letter confirms our discussion today that your employment with Willis Corporation is terminated effective immediately  You will receive two weeks severance pay since your employment with Willis Corporation has been less than one year  You will receive the severance payment once you have signed and returned the enclosed release of claims document  Additionally, payment for your accrued PTO will be included in your final paycheck* which you will receive on our regular payday, Friday  You may pick up this check from the reception desk or we can mail it to your home  Let us know about your choice  You can expect a separate benefits status letter that will outline the status of your benefits upon termination  The letter will include information about your eligibility for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation of group health coverage  We have received from you already your security swipe card, your office key, and the company-owned laptop and cell phone at the termination meeting  You will need to keep the company informed of your contact information so that we are able to provide the information you may need in the future such as your W-2 form and followup COBRA information Please let us know if we can assist you during your transition  The purpose of this letter is to follow up with you after your termination meeting this morning  It contains information you will need as you seek new employment opportunities  First, due to the termination of your employment, if you return to the workplace, your presence will be considered trespassing  You cleared out your cubicle and took all of your personal belongings with you and you turned in your company laptop and employee badge so you should have no reason to return  We are not offering you any severance pay because your employment was terminated for a cause which we covered with you at the termination meeting  Your accrued PTO will be included in your final paycheck* which you will receive on our regular payday, one week from this Friday  We will mail your final paycheck to the address we have on record which is where we are sending this termination letter  If this is not the proper address for the paycheck, please send an email to the HR manager, Ellen Parling, with the preferred address  We will send a separate benefits status letter that will outline the benefits you will receive following the termination of your employment  The letter will include information about your eligibility for COBRA, a continuation of group health coverage  Please keep the HR office up-to-date on your contact information so that we are able to provide the information you may need in the future such as your W-2 form and the follow-up COBRA information  Thank you for your offer of the position of Regional Manager of Product Development for the Witten Company  I am impressed with the depth of knowledge of your development team and believe that my experience will help to maximize the profitability of the department  I would like to meet with you regarding the salary and benefits you have offered before I make a final decision  I feel that with the skills, experience, and contacts in the industry that I would bring to Witten, further discussion of my compensation would be appropriate  Thank you very much for your consideration \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
